Brute Force Protection Module

This module implements progressive delay-based protection against brute force
login attacks. It tracks failed login attempts per IP address and applies
increasing delays to slow down attackers.

Features:
- Progressive delays: Each failed attempt increases the delay
- Automatic cleanup: Old tracking data expires after 1 hour
- IP-based tracking: Separate counters for each attacker
- Configurable: Easy to adjust delay times and thresholds
